# DOT39
DOT39 is the open source roadway design software for civil engineers. It includes a powerful toolset 
allowing civil engineers to design roads easier and quicker.

## Overview
* **Its own dog** DOT39 isn't based around other CAD program designs. It uses completely 
different engines and solvers, along with a unique user-interface.

* **Fast and optimized** DOT39 loads quick even on low-end laptops. It is optimized for success
using a minimal design (simple interface, follows the 80/20 rule, efficient item rendering)

* **Technology and libraries** 
  * **ModernGL** A fast 3D graphics library implemented in C++ and ported to Python
  * **PyQt** User interface library for fast loading, complex UI design

## The Plan
Right now, DOT39 is in the development stage. We plan to release the first beta/alpha versions for free, and the final 
1.0 release will be available for $100. Our main goal is to stay away from a SaaS approach and focus on a 
**one-time-payment** for lifetime access. DOT39 will always be open source alongside all of this, as we 
believe anybody should be able to see what a program is doing.
