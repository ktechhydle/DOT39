# DOT39
DOT39 is the open source roadway design software for civil engineers. It includes a powerful _(yet simple)_ toolset 
allowing civil engineers to design roads easier and quicker.

We designed DOT39 to be **direct**. When you press a button, or choose an action, a ton of "choose this, edit this" 
dialogs won't pop up. Instead, you will be greeted with a easy-to-use, fast, unique window. It provides a quick and 
fast approach to prevent hours of dialog surfing just to edit a label.

That is exactly what makes DOT39 unique, it isn't based around other CAD program designs. It is its own different 
system proven to be easier to work with.

The roadway design and planning process should be quick when it comes to your software. If you want to create an 
alignment, there are literally three steps:

1. Press the "Create Alignment" button
2. Edit and define your alignment points in a table editor
3. Auto generate alignment curves based on defined standards

In DOT39, four different dialogs and windows to create a alignment don't exist. Its entirely done all in one _unified_ 
dialog.

## The Plan
Right now, DOT39 is in it's development stage. We plan to release the first beta/alpha versions for free, and the final 
1.0 release will be available for $100. Our main goal is to stay away from a SaaS approach and focus on a 
**one-time-payment** for lifetime access. DOT39 will **always be open source**, as we believe _anybody_ 
should be able to see what a program is doing and study it.
