# DOT39
DOT39 is the open source roadway design software for civil engineers available for a lifetime fee of $100. It includes 
a powerful _(yet simple)_ toolset allowing civil engineers to design roads easier and quicker.

We designed DOT39 to be **direct**. When you press a button, or choose an action, a ton of "choose this, edit this" 
dialogs won't pop up. Instead, you will be greeted with a easy-to-use, fast, unique window. It provides a quick and 
fast approach to prevent hours of dialog surfing just to edit a label.

That is exactly what makes DOT39 unique, it isn't based around other CAD program designs. It is its own different 
system proven to be easier to work with.

The roadway design and planning process should be quick when it comes to your software. If you want to create an 
alignment, there are literally two steps:

1. Press the "Create Alignment" button
2. Edit and define your alignment in a table editor

In DOT39, four different dialogs and windows to create a alignment don't exist. Its entirely done all in one _unified_ 
dialog.
