# DOT39
DOT39 is the open source roadway design software for civil engineers. It includes a powerful toolset 
allowing engineers to design roads easier and quicker.

We designed DOT39 to be _direct_. When you press a button, or choose an action, a ton of "choose this, edit this" 
dialogs will not pop up. It provides a simple and fast approach rather than hours of dialog surfing just to edit
a label.

The roadway design and planning process should be easy. Let the app do most of the work for you, because that is what 
it is there for.
